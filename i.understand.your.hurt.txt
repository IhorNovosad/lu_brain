Look, I understand you got hurt 
(and we could talk about it if you would call me). 
But trying to hurt others will not help you. 
Nor anybody is going to pity you either. 

Why? Because you are almost 40, not 14. 
Forty! Not fourteen, but 40! 
You are not a teenager anymore; you are an adult for many years now. 
Remember you said in 2001 this: "I am an adult, 
so I have decided not to go to the US"? 
It was 20 years ago! Remember? 
Then start acting like one.

Forget your made-up lies about imaginary sicknesses. 
Instead, recollect and try to remember that you are 
a parent and a husband now. You are a father; you have a son and wife. 
It is YOUR job now to build a great life for him, yourself, and your wife. 
Remember yourself talking about what wonderful life your family will have? 

You got your chance in a great country. 
Use it! Now or never. 
Or you think when you are 50, you get a better opportunity? 
"Ex-wife" and step-father for your son do not associate with an excellent life for anybody. 
It is your responsibility (you are 40, remember?) to correct that (and anything else as well).

You are almost 40, meaning there is no much time. 
Therefore, get your shit together like your parents had done 
long before their forties and get to work.
